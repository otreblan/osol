# OperationsSolver

- The expression tree is mandatory to allow dynamic variables.
- For 2 extra points, make a validator for your solver, for example:
	* Remove unnecesary spaces
	* Validate that the equations is correct (e.g. it doesn't have extra parenthesis, no situations like 5//6)

## Build
``` bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
